![Welcome to 50 Million customers](https://github.com/FlexShopper/FSDOCS/blob/master/Integrations/assets/50-million.png)

#### Overview
FlexShopper spends millions of dollars in marketing, specifically targeted to 50 million Americans with little to no credit.  **We offer three (3) major integration channels** to tap into this customer base.  And, once you are integrated with FlexShopper we use these channels to drive customers into your stores and website.  We offer the largest Rent-To-Own [Marketplace](https://github.com/FlexShopper/FSDOCS/blob/master/Integrations/marketplace.md) online, where your products can be featured and sold with our marketing dollars.  We use the Marketplace as a vehicle to drive consumers to your website, where they can shop and pay at checkout with our [Payment Method](https://github.com/FlexShopper/FSDOCS/blob/master/Integrations/payment-method.md).  Finally after shopping on your website if a customer decides they want to walk into a store to see your products they can use our [In Store Kiosk](url) to checkout.
